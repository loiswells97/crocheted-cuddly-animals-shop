# crocheted-cuddly-animals-shop

This is a Java command line application created as part of my Software Engineering Masters.
The crocheted cuddly animals shop was inspired by Vanessa Mooncie's wonderful crochet patterns in her books Crocheted Cuddly Animals and Crocheted Sea Creatures. 
Sadly there aren't actually any cuddly animals for sale - you'll have to make your own!
